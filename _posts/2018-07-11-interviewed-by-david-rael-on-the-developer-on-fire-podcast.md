I'm very excited to share with you all that [I was interviewed by David Rael](http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-354-sirar-salih-lit-up-on-community) on his famous [Developer On Fire](http://developeronfire.com/) podcast! It was such a great and fun experience talking with David about all things tech and human related. I hope that this episode on his podcast will help inspire people in the IT industry. Among the things that we talked about was human empathy, burnout, community involvement and lots of other interesting things.

Have a listen at his podcast and let me know what you think in the comments!
