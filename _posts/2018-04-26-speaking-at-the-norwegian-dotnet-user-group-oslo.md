Two days ago I presented my talk titled *Azure Table Storage: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly* at the [Norwegian .NET User Group Oslo (NNUG Oslo)](https://www.meetup.com/NNUGOslo/) (of which I'm also a board member of). The presentation went really well and it was recorded, I thought that I would share the video with you all. It's hosted over at [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) by the official [NNUG channel](https://vimeo.com/nnug). Check it out:

As you've probably noticed, I'm doing a tour around the globe presenting this talk. My next speaking engagement will be at the [SATURN 2018 conference in Texas, USA](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/events/saturn/), in May this year.
