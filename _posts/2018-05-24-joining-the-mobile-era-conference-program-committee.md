The adventure started last year when I was invited by the crew at [Mobile Era Conference](https://mobileera.rocks/) to attend the conference for free. It was an invitation extended to me because of my active involvement in the Oslo community. I was really excited by this, I attended the conference and I had a real blast! My good friends Johannes Brodwall ([@jhannes](https://twitter.com/jhannes)) and Maxim Salnikov ([@webmaxru](https://twitter.com/webmaxru)) help run the conference. 

So because of my great experience attending the conference, I'm happy to announce that I decided to join the program committee. I'm really looking forward to contributing to the speaker selection process of this amazing and fun conference. By the way, the call for papers is still open and ends on May 31st, so make sure to submit a talk today!
