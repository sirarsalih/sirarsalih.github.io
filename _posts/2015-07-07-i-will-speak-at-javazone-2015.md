<p>I'm excited to announce that <a href="http://2015.javazone.no/details.html?talk=acebf1e3eee01e898dce83500151c00ddf734eafe9fc17721f550477890791dd">I will be speaking at JavaZone 2015</a>! If you did not know already, <a href="http://2015.javazone.no/">JavaZone</a> is the largest IT conference in Norway. Up to 2500 software engineers gather each year in Oslo to attend 2 days packed with presentations, lightning talks and workshops!</p>
<p>I will be doing an hour presentation on the upcoming Angular 2.0; "Angular 2 + TypeScript = true. Let's Play!". Make sure to book your ticket today and I will see you in September! :)</p>
