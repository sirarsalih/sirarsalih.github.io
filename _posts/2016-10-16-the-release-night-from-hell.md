Friday October 14, 2016. That Friday was supposed to be like any other. I would be heading off to work, I would do what I was planning to do then head home and embrace the weekend. It would be a good Friday concluding a long week. There was only one thing that stood out that day; it was release day. I work in a two-man development team and my colleague was on holiday abroad. I was supposed to release what we have been developing for the past four weeks (although we're capable of doing continuous delivery to production, the major bulk of our release follows a four week cycle due to legacy dependencies), this wasn't really a big deal since I'd been soley releasing our application for quite a while. The only thing that stood out this time is that I would be alone. I thought it no big deal, I've done it in the past and so got the experience to handle issues. Also, during each release my colleague and I had finessed the process and continuously updated all documentation. I was ready for this (boy, was I wrong).

The day started with me arriving at work a bit later than usual, reason being that I had been working a bit late the day before to finalize a demo for the business. I was very excited that day. I was going to show off something new of version Y, and then I was going to start scheduling the release of version X of our application. I ran the demo at 10:00 AM, finishing off at 10:30 AM. The business were happy and I was happy. I grabbed some lunch, then headed back to my computer to get mentally ready for the release. I like to be efficient, so I thought, maybe I can code some of the changes that the business pointed out during the demo to version Y, before I get started of scheduling the version X release. I did the changes and finished off at around 02:00 PM. Alright, I thought, time to get started on the release. I set my status on Skype to Busy. Our application consists of five components that need to be deployed. We schedule the deployment of each component so that this happens automatically. This Friday it was a bit different though. One of the components had to be manually deployed due to a server change, we agreed that the manual trigger would be made by the infrastructure team since the server change was made by them. They would click the button on that one. The rest of the components would be automatically deployed at different time intervals. Of course, before I got to this bit, I had to start merging the code. I was in for a treat.

We use git and follow the git flow principle. During this release, we had done changes to the two major components of our application. Therefore I had two code bases which I had to merge. I started
