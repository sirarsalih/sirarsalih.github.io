*The Oslo Software Architecture (OSWA) 2018 board. PS: Mario Ek Aparicio is also in the board but is not in the picture.*

I'm very happy to announce that I've joined the [Oslo Software Architecture (OSWA)](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Software-Architecture/) board. This has been a long-awaited dream of mine, the [OSWA](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Software-Architecture/) user group is very popular in Oslo and currently has well over 2000 members. The board does an amazing job by frequently hosting meetups, I'm looking forward to joining this great bunch and further contributing to the software architecture community in Oslo!
