I'm very excited to share with you all that I'll be speaking at Cloud Developer Days in Kraków, Poland at the end of May! I'm really looking forward to visiting one of my favorite European cities once again, Kraków has a special place in my heart.

I'll be doing two sessions at the conference, topics are Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Functions and Azure DevOps. This will be fun, I hope to see you there!
