I'm very excited to share with you all that I'll be speaking at [Cloud Developer Days 2019 in Krak√≥w, Poland](http://cloud.developerdays.pl/) at the end of May! I'm really looking forward to visiting one of my favorite European cities once again.

I'll be doing two sessions at the conference. Topics are Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Functions and Azure DevOps. This will be real fun, I hope to see you there!
