For the third year in a row, I'm excited to announce that [I'll be speaking at this year's JavaZone 2016 conference](https://2016.javazone.no/program/lets-overengineer-the-hell-out-of-this). JavaZone is the largest IT conference in Norway, and this year the conference will be celebrating its 15 year anniversary.

I'll be doing a lightning talk about a destructive force that developers often struggle with; overengineering. Make sure to book your conference ticket and I hope to see you in September!
