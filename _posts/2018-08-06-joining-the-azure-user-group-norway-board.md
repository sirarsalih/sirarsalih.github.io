I'm very excited to share with you all that I've joined the [Azure User Group Norway](https://www.meetup.com/Azure-User-Group-Norway/) board. I work with Azure on a daily basis and also in my free time; speaking at conferences, contributing to the open source arena as well as actively blogging about it. My focus moving forward is to continue spreading the word about Azure, as the benefits of using it are immense. You can do so many awesome things with Azure, [here is an overview of all the available Azure products](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/), oh so many!

I'm looking forward to contributing further to the Azure community in Norway!
