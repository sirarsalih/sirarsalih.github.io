title: Successfully setting up your Git repository in Azure
tags: [azure]

Some time ago I experienced problems setting up my Git repository in Azure. I had created an Azure application service and wanted to host my code in Azure, so that I could do continuous integration and be able to use all the awesome stuff from [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) on code push. It wasn't easy to get it right, but after some digging and try-and-fail I finally managed to get it working. I thought that I would share with you in a step-by-step guide how I finally got it working.
