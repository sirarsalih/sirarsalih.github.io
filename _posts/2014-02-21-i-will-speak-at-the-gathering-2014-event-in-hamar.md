<p>I will be speaking at the <a title="The Gathering 2014" href="http://html5devconf.com/">The Gathering 2014</a> event in Hamar (Norway) this April. If you didn't know already, this is the biggest gaming event in Norway. It is a huge computer LAN event that started out back in 1996 and has since taken place every year during the Easter holidays in Norway. The event takes place at the awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikingskipet" title="The Viking Ship Olympic Arena">Viking Ship Olympic Arena</a>, where over five thousand national and international participants meet to have fun. The majority of the participants are gamers, but there are also artists, designers and developers. Participants get to play games and attend creative seminars and workshops in the span of five days.</p>
<p>I will be holding a talk about "Clean Code" in the creative lounge section, I will also hold various HTML5/JavaScript workshops. I'm excited about this and hope to see you there too! :)</p>
