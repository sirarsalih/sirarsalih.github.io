<p>I will be speaking at the <a title="HTML5 Developer Conference" href="http://html5devconf.com/">HTML5 Developer Conference</a> in San Francisco this year! I received this exciting news yesterday night at around 02:00 AM in the morning. I'm glad that I didn't read the e-mail at that time, otherwise I wouldn't have slept because of all the excitement! If you didn't already know, this is the largest JavaScript and HTML5 conference in the world. It's an awesome conference that spans one day with training sessions spanning four days in advance. The topic of my talk is titled "TDD with AngularJS and TypeScript". I will get further details surrounding the talk eventually, whether it will be a workshop session or regular talk (or both).</p>
<p>Make sure you to book your tickets today, I'll see you in 'frisco this May! :)</p>
