I'm super excited to announce that I will be speaking at the [SATURN 2018 software architecture conference](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/events/saturn/) in Texas, USA, in May this year! This is really nice news, especially following [the grand announcement](https://sirarsalih.com/2018/01/31/and-so-begins-a-new-adventure/) that I shared with you all some time ago. I have never been to Texas before, so I'm really looking forward to the trip there in May. The SATURN 2018 conference is looking really nice with an [impressive range of speakers so far](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/events/saturn/speakers.cfm). Without giving away too much information to keep it a fun surprise, the title of the talk that I will be doing is *Azure Table storage: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly*. So there you go, I'm looking forward to talk about this and maybe I will see you there?
