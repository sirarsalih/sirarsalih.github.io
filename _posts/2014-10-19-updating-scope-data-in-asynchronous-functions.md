<p>One of the many lovely things about Angular is the fluid two-way data binding that we get with the framework. Although not entirely perfect when it comes down to performance, it saves us quite a lot of timeÂ and effort when writing web applications.</p>
<p>When it comes to asynchronousy, however, it should be noted that doing changes to your <code>$scope</code> data does not propagate to the view implicitly (!). In other words, if you do a change to a <code>$scope</code> variable from asynchronous context, the change is not reflected in the view. Let's look at an example. Consider the following controller that uses JavaScript's asynchronous <code>setInterval</code> function to update a counter every second:<br />
[code language="javascript"]<br />
function Ctrl ($scope) {<br />
    $scope.counter = 0;</p>
<p>    setInterval(function() {<br />
        $scope.counter++;<br />
    }, 1000);<br />
}<br />
[/code]<br />
This code looks pretty good and dandy, right? Unfortunately, no. Although the counter does get updated every second, it does not propagate the change to the view. There are a couple of ways to solve this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Invoking $apply Manually</strong></p>
<p>The simplest and most straightforward way is to invoke <code>$apply</code> manually in the asynchronous context. Consider the following change to our initial example (lines 5 - 7):<br />
[code language="javascript"]<br />
function Ctrl ($scope) {<br />
    $scope.counter = 0;</p>
<p>    setInterval(function() {<br />
        $scope.$apply(function () {<br />
            $scope.counter++;<br />
        });<br />
    }, 1000);<br />
}<br />
[/code]<br />
This change will force the counter updates through to the view.</p>
<p><strong>Using Angular's Asynchronous Services</strong></p>
<p>This approach is case specific. For instance, you can use the services <code>$interval</code> or <code>$timeout</code>, which actually behind the scenes invoke <code>$apply</code> - relieving you from doing so manually. Considering our initial example, we can therefore inject and use $interval in our controller instead:<br />
[code language="javascript"]<br />
function Ctrl ($scope, $interval) {<br />
    $scope.counter = 0;</p>
<p>    $interval(function () {<br />
        $scope.counter++;<br />
    }, 1000);<br />
}<br />
[/code]<br />
As the previous approach, this will propagate the counter updates to the view. I recommend using Angular's services wherever this is possible and seems appropriate to the case at hand. However, always keep in mind that such services invoke <code>$apply</code> for you behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this Sunday's little reading! :)</p>
